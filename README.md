# Perceptron
A simple [linear separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification). Inspired by lectures and slides by prof. Ray Mooney, Univeristy of Texas at Austin, describing the original [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. This implementation uses examples represented as 2-tuples of the following form:

`((input weights), classification)`

Where the first item is a weight vector represented as a k-tuple, and the second item is the classification modeled as `True` or `False`. An example of the Perceptron class in use is provided at the end of the file perceptron.py.
